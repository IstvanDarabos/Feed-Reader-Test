# Feed Reader Test

Project Purpose:
This application will be running some tests using Jasmine.JS.
This test was built as a Udacity Course project.

How to Load the test :
Open to index.html

## The Tests:
1. Test: that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object
 and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Test: that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object
 and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Test: suite named "The menu".
4. Test: that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
 We'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
5. Test: that ensures the menu changes visibility when
 the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
6. Test: suite named "Initial Entries"
7. Test: that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
8. Test: suite named "New Feed Selection".
9. Test: that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
